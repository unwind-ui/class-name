# Introduction

## Motivation

A simple request to add a component variation should not become a battle of specificities.
The issues starts to pop especially when components are wrapped (or better say _trapped_) within other components.

Fixing visual issues becomes complex and the _**"solution"**_ is usually to use a stronger selector.
It is understandable, because there is no UI component that could support all of the use-cases you might come across.
Touching the code of the UI component to fix the issue is not ideal either as your _fix_ might break something else.
Hence, you are left with only _sane_ option to **add** an extra class selector to target your case.

At that very point any component will become hard to extend and hard to maintain.
And it will bite you later.

## When to use

**Components created with `@unwind/class-name` library gives you full control of the component look with a single prop.**

You can create UI components that allow consumers:

- **replace only the pieces that need to be changed**
- **redefine everything from the scratch**

All that without touching the original code of the component aligned with [the openâ€“closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle).
This makes creating sharable UI components that allows changing provided styles a breeze.
No more being unable to remove that one selector that causes you headaches in your case
without fear of breaking someone elses code.

Instead of default `string | undefined` values, with `@unwind/class-name` you can create components that can accept also other types of values:

- [class name primitives](../api/class-name/type/class-name-primitive)
- [class name callbacks](../api/class-name/type/class-name-callback)
- [arrays of primitives or callbacks](../api/class-name/type/host-class-name)
- [nested class name objects](../api/class-name/type/class-name-object)

:::note Note that if your components rely on other than [CSS class selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) to define their looks, you might not need this library at all.
:::

## Adoption in 2 (or 3) steps

**Rewriting you components will consist of:**

### Step 1: Re-define class names

Redefining the class name (selectors) the component provides depending on how the class selectors are generated:

<DocCardList
	className="not:text--truncate"
  items={[
    {
      "type": "link",
      "label": "Stateless class names",
      "href": "/docs/learn/defining-class-names/stateless-class-names",
      "docId": "learn/defining-class-names/stateless-class-names"
    },
    {
      "type": "link",
      "label": "Stateful class names",
      "href": "/docs/learn/defining-class-names/stateful-class-names",
      "docId": "learn/defining-class-names/stateful-class-names"
    },
    {
      "type": "link",
      "label": "Composing class names",
      "href": "/docs/learn/defining-class-names/composed-class-names",
      "docId": "learn/defining-class-names/composed-class-names"
    }
  ]}
/>

### Step 2: Resolve class names back to string

Depending on your component needs you might either want to resolve passed prop immediately or delegate resolution forward to a sub-component.

<DocCardList
  className="not:text--truncate"
  items={[
    {
      "type": "link",
      "label": "Resolving class names",
      "href": "/docs/learn/resolving-class-names/resolving-class-names",
      "docId": "learn/resolving-class-names/resolving-class-names"
    },
    {
      "type": "link",
      "label": "Resolving with delegate",
      "href": "/docs/learn/resolving-class-names/delegating-class-name-resolution",
      "docId": "learn/resolving-class-names/delegating-class-name-resolution"
    }
  ]}
/>

### Step 3: Update types (Typescript)

In case you use Typescript, third step is to update the public API of your component to accept new types of values through the `className` prop (or any other of your choice).

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
import type { ClassNameProp } from '@unwind/class-name'

type Props = {
	...
	// highlight-next-line
	className?: ClassNameProp<typeof ...>
	...
}
```
