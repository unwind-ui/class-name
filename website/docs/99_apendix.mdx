## Libraries worth mentioning

Although `@unwind/class-name` simplifies passing arrays of strings via `className`, it is up to you how you generate your class selectors.
Make sure to check other `className` related libraries to find best fit for your case:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/classname

If you look for more a simple solution to style nested components, take a look at [classer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@code-hike/classer).
